"""ideagraph.demo — a small, generic seed brain for onboarding (`ig init --demo`).

13 nodes over generic LLM/agent topics (no user-specific content), linked with
every edge type (similar, extends, contradicts, supersedes, same_as),
2 pending edges for the HITL review flow, an orphan island to demo `ig status`,
and 1 near-dup pair (0.78-0.92 band) to demo `ig near-dup` + `ig merge`.

Everything is deterministic and public-safe: no private data, no personal
defaults, neutral English texts that avoid the intent-marker vocabulary
(the demo mirrors the marker-free finding style used by the self-evolving
pipeline). Edge KIND values are canonical English (`similar`, `extends`,
`contradicts`, `supersedes`, `continues`, `same_as`) — matching the
engine emission since the v0.5 kind migration.

     " tasks.", "semantic", ["rag"]),
    # 1: dense retrieval
    ("Dense Retrieval computes dense vectors (embeddings) for queries and"
     " documents and retrieves by cosine similarity. Bi-encoders encode query"

    ("Agent Memory stores an agent's experience across sessions in a"

     " infrastructure for recall.", "semantic", ["memory"]),
    # 5: episodic memory

    ("Graph-RAG extends RAG with a knowledge graph: entities and relations"
