"""Recall tracking: what the memory is actually asked for.

A memory system that does not know which of its entries are ever retrieved
cannot decide what to keep, promote, or let decay — OpenClaw's dreaming
promotes a candidate only when it passed `minRecallCount` / `minUniqueQueries`,
and IdeaGraph had no such signal at all (every node was equally "fresh"
forever, all 2120 stuck in `probation`).

Two halves, deliberately split so the READ path stays cheap and git-clean:

  * `record(brain, query, node_ids)` — append ONE line to the local ledger
    `<brain>/recalls.jsonl` (gitignored). No read-modify-write of node files,
    no commit per search: a search must not dirty the brain.
  * `aggregate(brain)` — folds the ledger into the derived counters on the
    nodes (`recall_count`, `recall_queries`, `last_recalled`) and writes them
    back in ONE pass. Called by the dream pass / `ig recall --aggregate`.

The counters are DERIVED data, like INDEX.md: the ledger is the source of
truth, the node fields are the queryable projection.
