//! Reading a vendor CLI's stdout back into one answer, **one line at a time**.
//!
//! CLIs print one of two things. The plain form *is* the answer, but every vendor
//! decorates it — a banner naming the workdir and session, an agent/model header — and
//! stripping that by pattern ages badly, because the banner changes with every release.
//! The JSON Lines form has no banner, carries real token counts, names the tools the
//! agent ran, and — the reason this file is incremental — arrives *while the agent
//! works* rather than after it exits.
//!
//! [`Reader`] is a state machine over single lines so a live process can be rendered as
//! it speaks. [`read`] remains as a whole-buffer wrapper, so the fixtures that pin each
//! vendor's shape keep testing the same code the live path uses.
